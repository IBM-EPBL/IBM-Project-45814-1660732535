# IBM-Project-45814-1660732535
Emerging Methods for Early Detection of Forest Fires

## Project Objectives
### By the end of this project you will:
* You will be able to learn how to get and prepare the dataset.
* You will be able to know how to do image processing.
* You will understand how CNN layers are work.
* Classify images using a Convolutional Neural Network.
* You will be able to know what are the activation functions can be used.
* You will be able to know how to read images using OpenCV.
* You will know convolutional Neural Networks for Computer vision AI Problems.

## Project Flow
* The user interacts with a web camera to read the video.
* Once the input image from the video frame is sent to the model, if the fire is detected it is showcased on the console, and alerting sound will be generated and an alert message will be sent to the Authorities.

### To accomplish this, we have to complete all the activities and tasks listed below

#### Data Collection
* Collect the dataset or create the dataset.

#### Image Preprocessing
* Import ImageDataGenerator Library.
* Define the parameters /arguments for ImageDataGenerator class
* Applying ImageDataGenerator on trainset and test set.

#### Model Building
* Import the model building Libraries
* Initializing the model
* Adding CNN Layers
* Adding Hidden Layer
* Adding Output Layer
* Configure the Learning Process
* Training and testing the model
* Optimize the Model
* Save the Model

#### Video Streaming and alerting
* OpenCV for video processing
* Creating an account in Twilio service
* Use Twilio API to send messages.

## Pre-Requisites
### To complete this project you should have the following software  and packages 
#### Anaconda Navigator :
Anaconda Navigator is a free and open-source distribution of the Python and R programming languages for data science and machine learning related applications. It can be installed on Windows, Linux, and macOS.Conda is an open-source, cross-platform,  package management system. Anaconda comes with so very nice tools like JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebook,QtConsole, Spyder, Glueviz, Orange, Rstudio, Visual Studio Code. For this project, we will be using Jupiter notebook and spyder
To install Anaconda navigator and to know how to use Jupyter Notebook a Spyder using Anaconda watch the video

### To build Deep learning models you must require the following packages
#### Tensor flow: 
TensorFlow is an end-to-end open-source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers can easily build and deploy ML-powered applications.
#### Keras: 
Keras leverages various optimization techniques to make high-level neural network API easier and more performant. It supports the following features:
* Consistent, simple, and extensible API.
* Minimal structure - easy to achieve the result without any frills.
* It supports multiple platforms and backends.
* It is a user-friendly framework that runs on both CPU and GPU.
*  Highly scalability of computation.
